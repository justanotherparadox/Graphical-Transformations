Mathematics of Graphical Transformations in 2D and 3D

This repo contains screenshots of 2nd and 3rd chapters of a book named 'Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics' by Rogers and Adams, a few cool links on where to read Linear Algebra for computer graphics and about curves, some text references and some of my hand written notes.

Additional changes will be informed.
